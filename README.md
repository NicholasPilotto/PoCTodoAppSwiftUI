# PoCTodoAppSwiftUI
This is a demo project, built following [iOS Accademy video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_mypMqSXNw) on YouTube. <br>
The main goal of this project is to learn how to use [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework.

## SwiftUI
_SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit that lets us design apps in a declarative way. Thatâ€™s a fancy way of saying that we tell SwiftUI how we want our user interface to look and work, and it figures out how to make that happen as the user interacts with it._ [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/what-is-swiftui).
